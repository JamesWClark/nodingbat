A web app built in meteor js, where users can practice programming problems
in javascript- and earn cute little bats along the way. The problems are based
off of <http://codingbat.com/>

## How you can help:
We need people to continue adding problems from the coding bat site. Eventually we want to add other
material, like the euler problems and stuff that professors use in classes. If interested in helping out,
please read the style guide for adding problems either from codingbat(ones we haven't done yet are listed below),
OR your own problems. The style guide is below:

## Converting Coding bat exercises:
(Here's an example for adding this exercise)
1.  Pick a problem- solve it in java/python, so you can see the test cases to use against the javascript version of your function. ![oops](/public/1.png)
2. If you haven't already, git clone the repo and open the 3 files: 
/server/server.js 
/lib/setup.js
/solutions.js
3. After sovling the exercise, rewrite the function in solutions.js (make sure the function works and you can take the console logs out)
